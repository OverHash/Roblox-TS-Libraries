/**
 * Global updates is a powerful feature of ProfileService, used for sending information to a desired player profile across servers, within the server or to a player profile that is not currently active in any Roblox server (Kind of like [MessagingService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/MessagingService), but slower and doesn't require the recipient to be active). The primary intended use of global updates is to support sending gifts among players, or giving items to players through a custom admin tool. The benefit of using global updates is it's API simplicity (This is as simple as it gets, sorry ðŸ˜‚) and the fact that global updates are pulled from the DataStore whenever the profile is auto-saved **at no additional expense of more DataStore calls!**
 *
 * Global updates can be `Active`, `Locked` and `Cleared`:
 * - Whenever a GlobalUpdate is created, it will be `Active` by default
 * - `Active` updates can be **changed** or **cleared** within a `.GlobalUpdateProfileAsync()` call
 * - Normally, when the profile is active on a Roblox server, you should always progress all `Active` updates to the `Locked` state.
 * - `Locked` updates can no longer be **changed** or **cleared** within a `.GlobalUpdateProfileAsync()` call.
 * - `Locked` updates are ready to be processed (e.g. add gift to player inventory) and immediately `Locked` by calling `.LockActiveUpdate(updateId)`
 * - `Cleared` updates will immediately disappear from the profile forever.

	 * 
	 * - Pass `nil` for `sort_direction`, `min_date` and `max_date` to find the oldest available version
	 * - Pass `Enum.SortDirection.Descending` for `sort_direction`, `nil` for `min_date` and `max_date` to find the most recent version.

	 * 
	 * **Case example: "I lost all of my rubies on August 14th!"**
	 * ```ts
	 * // Get a ProfileStore object with the same arguments you passed to the
	 * //   ProfileStore that loads player Profiles. It can also just be
