roblox-ts typings of [`virtualized-list-lua`](https://github.com/jsdotlua/virtualized-list-lua) for Roblox.

## Installation

To use, [`@rbxts/react-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/react-ts) must be installed first.

Then, install `virtualized-list`!

```bash
npm install @rbxts/virtualized-list
```

## Changes from Luau version and compatibility

A few minimal changes from the original source have been made to have better roblox-ts compatiblity:

- `flipper` import has been updated to reflect the [`@rbxts/flipper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/flipper) package exported path

## Sources

`virtualized-list` sources were derived from [DefinitelyTyped/react-native](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/react-native/v0.68), with some minor modifications being performed to have compatibility with `@rbxts/react-ts`.
